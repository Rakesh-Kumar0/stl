What is a set?
A set in STL is a container that stores unique elements in a particular order. 
Every operation on a set takes O(1) complexity in the average case and takes O(n) in the worst case.

##Functions in set:
insert() – to insert an element in the set.
set<int> s;
s.insert(1);
s.insert(2);

begin() – return an iterator pointing to the first element in the set.
s.begin();

end() – returns an iterator to the theoretical element after the last element.
s.end();

count() – returns true or false based on whether the element is present in the set or not.
set<int> s;
s.insert(1);
s.insert(2);
s.count(2); //returns true


clear() – deletes all the elements in the set.
s.clear();

find() – to search an element in the set.
set<int> s;
s.insert(1);
s.insert(2);
if(s.find(2)!=s.end())
cout<<"true"<<endl;

erase() – to delete a single element or elements between a particular range.
s.erase();

size() – returns the size of the set.
s.size();

empty() – to check if the set is empty or not.
s.empty();

Other functions:
cbegin() – it refers to the first element of the set.
cend() – it refers to the theoretical element after the last element of the set.
rbegin() – it points to the last element of the set.
rend() – it points to the theoretical element before the first element of the set.
bucket_size() – gives the total number of elements present in a specific bucket in a set.
emplace() – to insert an element in the set.
max_size() – the maximum elements a set can hold.
max_bucket_count() – to check the maximum number of buckets a set can hold.
