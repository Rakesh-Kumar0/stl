/*

What is a multimap in C++ STL?
multimap in STL are associative containers like maps where each element consists of a key 
value and a mapped value, the only difference is multimaps can store duplicate elements

## Functions in the multimap:

insert() to insert an element in the multimap.
begin() return an iterator pointing to the first element in the multimap.
end() returns an iterator to the theoretical element after the last element.
clear() deletes all the elements in the multimap.
find() to search for an element in the map.
erase() to delete a single element or elements between a particular range.
size() returns the number of elements in the multimap.
empty() to check if the multimap is empty or not.

/*
Other functions:
cbegin() – it refers to the first element of the multimap.
cend() – it refers to the theoretical element after the last element of the multimap.
rbegin() – it points to the last element of the multimap.
rend() – it points to the theoretical element before the first element of the multimap.
emplace() – to insert an element in the multimap.
max_size() – the maximum elements a multimap can hold.
